Libraries:
1. Numpy
2. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
4. TensorFlow-Keras
5. Random
6. JSON
7. Pickle

Key Features:
1. The chatbot interacts with users, responding to their messages based on predefined intents and responses stored in a JSON file.
2. Utilizes a deep learning model trained on tokenized and lemmatized input sentences to predict appropriate responses.
3. The model is trained on the fly as new data is provided, enabling it to adapt and improve its responses over time.
4. Utilizes a learning rate decay schedule during model training to improve convergence and performance.
5. Trained model parameters are saved to disk for future use, ensuring the chatbot's state is maintained across sessions.
